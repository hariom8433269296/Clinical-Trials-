    Below are the most impactful features identified using SHAP analysis across tree-based models:

    - **Outcome Measures**: Survival-related measures (`is_os_present`, `is_pfs_present`, `is_response`) had high correlation with trial success.
    - **Trial Structure**: Longer follow-up durations, higher number of comparison arms, and posted results (`was_result_posted`) aligned with approvals.
    - **Population**: Trials involving children (`Age_CHILD`) or adult-specific cohorts showed differing patterns.
    - **Drug Novelty**: Trials backed by rare or novel drugs often faced more scrutiny, seen via `drug_novelty_score`.
    - **Sponsor Tiers**: Tiered sponsor power contributed to variance in outcome likelihood.
    - **Enrollment Stats**: Higher site and patient count added to approval probability.
